Communote
==========

This website will host notes and tests from any school and sort it by course, school, and textbook.

This repository will act as the temporary location of the website before we buy hosting.

We will keep the planning documentation in a [Google Docs folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BxW61uJyyN8TeXBVX1RQQURaU0U&usp=sharing).

The layouts can be viewed, using [Balsamiq Mock-ups](http://balsamiq.com/download/)
